# Merging Properties of a Cellular Automaton for Blocking Queen Games

## Abstract

This thesis provides an in-depth analysis of a substructure, called the *warp*, of a cellular automaton for blocking queen games proposed by Cook and Larsson in 2016. We show that a simple toy model can be used to examine threads of winning positions in the warp and present several findings relating to the number sequences they produce. The game of interest, *k-blocking Wythoff Nim*, may be summarized as a game where the moves correspond to moving a queen in chess, but only towards $(0,0)$ and with the restriction that an opposite player may block up to $k-1$ positions temporarily. As soon as a player runs out of possible moves, the game ends and the last player to move wins. The game gives rise to highly complex structures which are sensitive to the parameter $k$. However, the threads of winning positions in the warp seem to have consistent thicknesses which add up to Fibonacci numbers. The final toy model we propose exhibits the same merging property as the cellular automaton and gives rise to a class of toy models based on the infinite Fibonacci word.
